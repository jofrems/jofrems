- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @jofrems - Computer Science engineer / FullStack Developer

Iâ€™ve just finished bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science Engineering.
Now Iâ€™m looking for new opportunities that let me expand my
knowledge and learn more about all the new technologies that are
being developed every day.
Iâ€™m ready to learn and adapt to different ways of working in big
teams to keep growing in my career and to keep my skills challenged
and updated.
Solid academic knowledge in:
- Programming
- Projects management

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning IA (Deep Learning) in a self-taught way, I've already trained and finetunned a TTS-Model, you can check it out in my repository called TTS_VITS_Finetuned.
